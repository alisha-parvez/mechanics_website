            The shear force, axial force and bending moment are denoted by V, P and M respectively<br>
            In order to find their values, we apply the equilibrium equations (Fx=0, Fy=0 and Mz=0) but here, for each equation,
            we balance the external forces with the internal forces.<br>
            The sign convention adopted for P, V and M is shown.<br>
            An easy way to remember the conventions is: For axial force, positive is directed away from the beam.
            For bending moment, the beam becomes concave by applying positive moment (in the shape of a bowl)<br>

    <p>There are no horizontal forces in the given problem so the axial force is zero everywhere.<br></p>

      <p>
      For the shear force
      from A to C, <br>the <b>total external force in the positive V direction is +P/2</b>.
      <br>Hence, the internal force needed to balance it is -P/2.
      <br>Thus, the shear force <b>V is a constant equal to P/2 from A to C.</b><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the shear force from C to B,<br>
      The total external force in the positive V direction is -P + P/2 = -P/2<br>
      Thus, the internal force needed to balance this external force is<br> <b>V = -P/2</b> <br>(the direction of V is shown in the diagram : left section)

    </p>

    <p>
      At B, the shear force becomes -P/2 + P/2 = 0
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us consider the distance from A to be x<br>
      For the moment, from A to B,<br>
      the moment in the anticlockwise direction for the left section is given by,
      (-P/2)*x<br>
      Thus, the balancing internal bending moment <b>M is given by +1&frasl;2 Px</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the moment from B to C,<br>
      the moment in the clockwise direction is given by (P/2)*(x) - (P)*(x-1&frasl;2L) = -1&frasl;2 Px + 1&frasl;2 PL<br>
      Thus, the balancing internal moment is given by <br>
      <b>M = -1&frasl;2 Px + 1&frasl;2 PL</b><br>
    </p>
