      <p>
        The shear force, axial force and bending moment are denoted by V, P and M respectively<br>
        In order to find their values, we apply the equilibrium equations (Fx=0, Fy=0 and Mz=0) but here, for each equation,
        we balance the external forces with the internal forces.<br>
        The sign convention adopted for P, V and M is shown.<br>
        An easy way to remember the conventions is: For axial force, positive is directed away from the beam.
        For bending moment, the beam becomes concave by applying positive moment (in the shape of a bowl)<br>

      <p>By applying the same concepts to the given problem, we find that the expression for P, V and M are: <br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fx1 - Fx2 = 0</li>
        <li>-Fy1 - Fy2 + Fy3 + Fy4 + Fy5 = 0</li>
      </ul>
