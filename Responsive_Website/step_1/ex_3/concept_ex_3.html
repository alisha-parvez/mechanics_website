        Distributed forces are those forces that act on a large part of a surface, not just on one point.<br>
        In two dimesions, the intensity of a distributed force is the force per unit length. The intensity may vary or be constant <br>
        For purposes of analysis, the distributed force can be considered as a single force whose <b>magnitude</b> is the integral or
        summation of the length element times the intensity for that elemnent i.e. <b>(i)(dl)</b><br>
        It can be calculated as the 'area' of the figure of distributed force.<br>
        The force is considered to act at the centroid of the distributed force figure <br>
        E.g. For constant intensity, the magnitude is the the length for which the force acts times the force intensity i.e. the length*breadth of the rectangular
        figure and the force acts at the centre<br>
        E.g. For a linearly increasing intensity, the calculation is shown:<br>
