    For analysing beams with distributed forces as loads, the basic method remains the same.<br>
    However, here, when we take a section, the magnitude and position of the equivalent force of the distributed force
    depends on the value of x i.e. the distance from the left end to the point where the cut is made<br>

    <p>
      For the beam shown in the figure to the right, let us take a cut at a distance x from end A<br>
      The left section obtained (of length x) is shown <br>
      The equivalent force for the distributed force has a <b>magnitude wx</b> and is at a distance <b> 1&frasl;2 x from A</b>
      and is represented by the doted arrow in the diagram<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using <b>F<sub>y</sub>=0</b>, we get: <br>
      - wx - V = 0 => <b>V = -wx </b><br>
      Thus, the diagram for V is: <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using <b>M<sub>z</sub>=0</b> about A , we get: <br>
      - (wx)(1&frasl;2x) + M - (V)(x) = 0=> <b>M = - 1&frasl;2 wx<sup>2</sup> </b>
    </p>

    <p>Since there are no external forces along x axis, P is always 0 </p>

    <p>Now, let's solve a problem by applying what we have learnt here:<br><br></p>
