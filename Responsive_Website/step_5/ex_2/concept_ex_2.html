    A  hinge  can  transfer  axial  force  and  shear  force  but  not  bending  moment.  So,  bending moment at the hinge location is zero.
    We divide the beam into two parts and find the external reaction forces using the method discussed in step 1. The next step is to
    assume that the beam is in the original state and to draw the shear force diagram as usual, ignoring the hinge.

      <p>The first step is to solve for the hinge reactions. The hinge reactions for the following beam are shown in the 2nd
      figure. </p>

      <p>The axial force is zero throughout since there are no forces along the x direction</p>

      <p>The shear force remains zero from A till it reaches the 3m mark (where the 10 kN force acts). <br></p>
      <p>From this point till C, the shear force <b>V= -10 kN</b>. At C, the 22.5 kN force acts in the positive y direction.
      Thus, at C, the value of <b>V = + 12.5 kN</b>.</p>

      <p>At C, the ditributed load (5 kN/m)  starts acting and from C to D, the value of <b>V = 12.5kN - 5(x-4)</b> where x is the distance from A</p>

      <p>Thus, the shear force diagram for the given beam is: </p>
